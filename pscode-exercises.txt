// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Pseudocode:

Ask for the number 
If number is divisible by two, print "even" on the screen
If number is not divisible by two, print "odd" on the screen

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Pseudocode:

a)
Identify integer 'a'
Identify integer 'b'
Identify integer 'c'
Identify integer 'd'
Identify integer 'e'

b)
a + b + c + d + e = f

f/5 = the average of integers a, b, c, d, and e

c)
Compare the values of integers a, b, c, d, and e and distinguish which has the lowest value
Identify as integer 'g'
Compare the values of integers a, b, c, d, and e and distinguish which has the highest value
Identify as integer 'h'

d)
print "'f is the average of the given integers"
start a new line
print "'g' is the lowest value of the given variables"
print "'h' is the highest value of the given variables
